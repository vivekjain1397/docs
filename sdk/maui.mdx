## Install[#](#install)

Install the package from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RadarIO.Xamarin/):

```bash
Install-Package RadarIO.Xamarin
```

RadarIO.Xamarin supports both Xamarin and MAUI bindings.

If you have an iOS and an Android project, add the package to each project.

## Integrate[#](#integrate)

### Initialize[#](#initialize)

First, initialize the SDK:

```csharp
using RadarIO;
using static RadarIO.RadarSingleton;

namespace MyProject
{ 
  public class Example 
  { 
    void Example () 
    {
      RadarSingleton.Initialize(new RadarSDKImpl());
      Radar.Initialize(publishableKey); 
    } 
  }
}
```

### Identify user[#](#identify-user)

To identify the user when logged in, call:

```csharp
Radar.UserId = userId;
```

where `userId` is a stable unique ID for the user.

To set an optional dictionary of custom metadata for the user, call:

```csharp
Radar.Metadata = metadata;
```

where `metadata` is a `JSONObject` with up to 16 keys and values of type string, boolean, or number.

Finally, to set an optional description for the user, displayed in the dashboard, call:

```csharp
Radar.Description = description;
```

where `description` is a string.

You only need to call these functions once, as these settings will be persisted across app sessions.

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these functions in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Request permissions[#](#request-permissions)

Before tracking the user's location, the user must have granted location permissions for the app.

See the [MAUI Permissions docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/appmodel/permissions) to learn how to check and request permissions.

### Foreground tracking[#](#foreground-tracking)

Once you have initialized the SDK and the user has granted permissions, you can track the user's location.

To track the user's location in the foreground, call:

```csharp
var (status, location, events, user) = await Radar.TrackOnce();
```

Learn about platform-specific implementations of this function in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Background tracking[#](#background-tracking)

On iOS and Android, once you have initialized the SDK and the user has granted permissions, you can start tracking the user's location in the background.

For background tracking, the SDK supports custom tracking options as well as three presets:

* **`TrackingOptionsEfficient`**: A low frequency of location updates and lowest battery usage. On Android, avoids Android vitals bad behavior thresholds.
* **`TrackingOptionsResponsive`**: A medium frequency of location updates and low battery usage. Suitable for most consumer use cases.
* **`TrackingOptionsContinuous`**: A high frequency of location updates and higher battery usage. Suitable for on-demand use cases (e.g., delivery tracking) and some consumer use cases (e.g., order ahead, "mall mode").

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these presets in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

To start tracking the user's location in the background, call one of:

```csharp
Radar.StartTracking(Radar.TrackingOptionsEfficient);
Radar.StartTracking(Radar.TrackingOptionsResponsive);
Radar.StartTracking(Radar.TrackingOptionsContinuous);
```

You only need to call these methods once, as these settings will be persisted across app sessions.

Though we recommend using presets for most use cases, you can customize the tracking options. See the [tracking options reference](/sdk/tracking).

```csharp
RadarTrackingOptions trackingOptions = Radar.TrackingOptionsContinuous;
trackingOptions.DesiredStoppedUpdateInterval = 180;
trackingOptions.DesiredStoppedUpdateInterval = 60;
trackingOptions.DesiredSyncInterval = 50;
trackingOptions.DesiredAccuracy = RadarTrackingOptionsDesiredAccuracy.High;
trackingOptions.StopDuration = 140;
trackingOptions.StopDistance = 70;
trackingOptions.Sync = RadarTrackingOptionsSync.All;
trackingOptions.Replay = RadarTrackingOptionsReplay.None;

Radar.StartTracking(trackingOptions);
```

To determine whether tracking has been started, call:

```csharp
Radar.IsTracking;
```

To stop tracking the user's location in the background (e.g., when the user logs out), call:

```csharp
Radar.StopTracking();
```

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these functions in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

To listen for events, location updates, and errors, you can add event listeners:

```csharp
Radar.ClientLocationUpdated += (result) =>
{ 
  // do something with result.location, result.stopped, result.source
};

Radar.LocationUpdated += (result) =>
{ 
  // do something with result.location, result.user
};

Radar.EventsReceived += (result) =>
{ 
  // do something with result.events, result.user
};

Radar.Error += (err) => 
{ 
  // do something with err
};
```

Listeners should be set only once and before tracking begins.

### Mock tracking[#](#mock-tracking)

On iOS and Android, you can simulate a sequence of location updates for testing. For example, to simulate a sequence of 10 location updates every 3 seconds by car from an `origin` to a `destination`, we can call:

```csharp
RadarLocation origin = new() { Latitude = 40.714708, Longitude = -74.035807 };
RadarLocation destination = new() { Latitude = 40.717410, Longitude = -74.053334 };

Radar.MockTracking(origin, destination, RadarRouteMode.Car, 10, 3, data =>
{ 
  System.Console.WriteLine($"{data.Location.Latitude} {data.Location.Longitude}");
});
```

### Trip tracking[#](#trip-tracking)

On iOS and Android, to start a trip to a destination, call:

```csharp
RadarTripOptions tripOptions = new()
{ 
  ExternalId = "299",
  DestinationGeofenceTag = "store", 
  DestinationGeofenceExternalId = "123", 
  Mode = RadarRouteMode.Car
};

await Radar.StartTrip(tripOptions);
Radar.StartTracking(Radar.TrackingOptionsContinuous);
```

Later, to complete the trip and stop tracking, call:

```csharp
await Radar.CompleteTrip();
Radar.StopTracking();
```

Or, to cancel the trip and stop tracking, call:

```csharp
await Radar.CancelTrip();
Radar.StopTracking();
```

Learn more about [trip tracking](/trip-tracking).

### Manual tracking[#](#manual-tracking)

You can manually update the user's location by calling:

```csharp
RadarLocation loc = new() { Latitude = 40.714708, Longitude = -74.035807, Accuracy = 65 };

var (status, location, events, user) = await Radar.TrackOnce(loc);
```

Learn about platform-specific implementation of this function in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).
