<Info>
  The Attentive integration is available on the [**Enterprise plan**](https://radar.com/pricing).
</Info>

Radar can sync locations from [Brandify](http://www.brandify.com) as geofences in Radar, powered by [geofence sync](#geofence-sync).

## Configuration

Ask your Brandify account manager to enable a published CSV of your locations as Radar geofences. Then, on the Radar [Integrations page](https://radar.com/dashboard/integrations) under _Geofence Sync_, set _Enabled_ to _Yes_. Enter the published CSV URL. Note that you can set separate URLs for the _Test_ and _Live_ environments.

The geofence sync CSV format is the same as the [geofence import CSV format](/geofences#csv-import).

When you click _Save and Sync_, Radar will attempt a one-time sync and send an email on success or failure. Radar will then attempt syncs nightly.
