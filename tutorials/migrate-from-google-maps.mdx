### []()Maps[#](#maps "Direct link to heading")

Google's maps offering is used for rendering maps in applications. Radar provides vector [base maps](https://radar.com/maps/maps) with beautiful out-of-the-box styles as an alternative. Check out the [maps explorer](https://radar.com/dashboard/maps/maps-explorer/maps) in the dashboard to see them in action.

| Google Maps Feature | Radar Feature                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Dynamic Maps        | [Dynamic Maps](/maps/maps)       |
| Static Maps         | [Static Maps](/maps/static-maps) |

### []()Places[#](#places "Direct link to heading")

Google's Places APIs enable finding and geocoding locations such as addresses and points of interest. Radar's [Geocoding and Search APIs](https://radar.com/maps/geocoding) provide fully featured geocoding, autocomplete, address validation, and geolocation APIs as an alternative.

| Current Place API      | [Context API](/api#context)                        |

### []()Routes[#](#routes "Direct link to heading")

Google's Routes APIs are used to calculate routes between locations or snap to roads. Radar's [routing APIs](https://radar.com/maps/routing) provide a suite of distance, matrix, directions, route match, and optimize APIs to power these use cases and more.
