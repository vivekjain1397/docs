[Radar](https://radar.com/) is full-stack location infrastructure for every product and service. Our [SDKs](https://docs.radar.com/sdk) and [APIs](https://docs.radar.com/api) make it easy to add location-based experiences to your app or website, from pickup and delivery tracking to location-based messaging to store locators and more.

Our [Geofencing Platform](https://docs.radar.com/geofencing/overview) is the industry-leading geofencing and location tracking platform, including geofencing, place visit detection, trip tracking, fraud detection, and analytics.

Our [Maps Platform](https://docs.radar.com/maps/overview) is a cost-effective solution for geocoding APIs, search APIs, routing APIs, and base maps.

We power location-based experiences for [enterprises and startups](https://radar.com/customers) across hundreds of millions of devices worldwide.
