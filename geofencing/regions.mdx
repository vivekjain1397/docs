## []()Quickstart[#](#quickstart "Direct link to heading")

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, enable Regions events on the [Settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings).

From there, [integrate the SDK](/sdk) and call `Radar.trackOnce()` or `Radar.startTracking()`, depending on your use case. Radar will generate an entry event on the first location update in a region matching your enabled event types.

Regions can automatically detect a user's home regions based on location updates in the last 30 days, and detect when a user is traveling outside of their home regions.

Coarse home detection provides the following user context:
