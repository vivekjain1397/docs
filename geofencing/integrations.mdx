description: "Radar supports a number of server-side integrations.  like webhooks, mParticle, and Braze allow you to send events from Radar to other systems.  like geofence sync and Yext allow you to sync geofences from other systems to Radar. Finally,  allow you to  and send live ETAs to other platforms."

### [Filters](#filters)

Click _Show Advanced_ on the [Integrations page](https://radar.com/dashboard/integrations) under an integration to show advanced filters.

To filter event types sent to an integration, select or unselect event types under _Event Type Allowlist_.

To filter keys from the request body sent to an integration, add keys, comma-separated, to _Request Key Blocklist_. For example, to skip sending `radar_geofence_ids` to the Segment `identify` call and to skip sending `geofence_id` to the Segment `track` call, add `radar_geofence_ids,geofence_id` to _Request Key Blocklist_.

To filter events sent to an integration based upon a [Geofence](/geofences) tag, add tags, comma-separated to _Geofence Tag Blocklist_. For example, to skip sending all events to the Amplitude integration for geofences tagged `gas-station` and `cafe`, add `gas-station,cafe` to _Geofence Tag Blocklist_.

## [Geofence integrations](#geofence-integrations)

_Geofence integrations_ allow you to sync geofences from other systems to Radar.
